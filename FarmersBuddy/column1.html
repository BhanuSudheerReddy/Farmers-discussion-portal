<li>In general, the soils of Kerala are acidic, kaolintic and gravelly with low CEC(Cation Exchange Capacity), low water holding capacity and high phosphate fixing capacity.</li>
<li>Climate topography, vegetation and hydrological conditions are the dominant factors of soil formation. On the basis of the morphological features and physico-chemical properties, the soils of the State have been classified into red loam, laterite coastal alluvium, riverine alluvium, Onattukara alluvium, brown hydromorphic, saline hydromorphic, Kuttanad alluvium, black soil and forest loam.</li>
<li>The soils have red colour, which has been attributed to the presence of hematite or anhydrous ferric oxides.</li>
<li>The rapid permeability of the surface soils also has been responsible for the characteristic development of these loamy oils, which are very deep and homogeneous without much expression of horizons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As per the USDA system of soil classification (Taxonomy), the soils of Tamil Nadu are classified in to Six orders </li>
